# Portfolio Project - string_manipulation Python Package and Documentation

Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository showcases the **string_manipulation** Python package, which consists of six simple but powerful functions designed to aid technical writers in cumbersome text editing tasks. Additionally, the project includes comprehensive docstrings, enabling the automatic compilation of the Reference chapter in the documentation. The documentation is created using Mkdocs and is written in Markdown, following the principles of Di√°taxis to ensure clarity and coherence.

The documentation project is hosted online at https://anna-niezychowska.github.io/SampleDocumentation/

## Introduction

As a technical writer, I understand the challenges of dealing with large amounts of text and the need for efficient tools to manipulate and edit strings. To address these needs, I developed the **string_manipulation** Python package, which offers six handy functions that simplify common text editing tasks.

The main goals of this project are to demonstrate my skills in writing clear and concise documentation.

## Installation

To use the **string_manipulation** package and explore the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anna-niezychowska/SampleDocumentation.git
cd SampleDocumentation
```

2. Ensure you have Python (version 3.9 or higher) installed on your system.

3. Install Mkdocs using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

## Usage

Once you have the project set up on your local machine, you can run the documentation website using Mkdocs. Here's how:

1. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd SampleDocumentation
```

2. Serve the documentation locally using the `mkdocs serve` command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

3. Open your web browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to access the locally hosted documentation.

## Reference

The Reference chapter in the documentation is automatically generated from comprehensive docstrings present in the source code of the **string_manipulation** package. These docstrings provide detailed information about each function, including their input parameters, return values, and usage examples.

To access the Reference chapter, please navigate to [Reference Documentation](https://anna-niezychowska.github.io/SampleDocumentation/docs/reference) (Replace `anna-niezychowska.github.io` with the actual URL where your documentation is hosted).
