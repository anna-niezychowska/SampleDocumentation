# Python String Manipulation Functions Tutorial

Welcome to the Python String Manipulation Functions tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, we will explore a collection of powerful Python functions designed to manipulate strings and lists of words. These functions will enable you to perform various text-related tasks with ease. In this tutorial, we will not only cover how to use the functions but also delve into their underlying algorithms and performance considerations. Let's dive in and gain a deeper understanding of each function.

## 1. `capitalize(input_string)`

The **'capitalize'** function is a handy tool when you want to convert a string into a title case, where the first character of each word is capitalized. It internally uses a combination of string manipulation techniques and regular expressions to achieve the desired result.

**Example**
```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import capitalize

# Call the function with your input string
input_string = "hello world"
result = capitalize(input_string)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'Hello World'

```

## 2. `lowercase(input_string)`

The **'lowercase'** function effectively utilizes the **str.lower()** method, but it also incorporates some optimizations to handle special characters and non-alphabetic characters more efficiently.

**Example**
```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import lowercase

# Call the function with your input string
input_string = "ThIs Is a MiXeD CaSe StRiNg"
result = lowercase(input_string)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'this is a mixed case string'

```

## 3. `uppercase(input_string)`

The **'uppercase'** function utilizes the **str.upper()** method, but it also takes advantage of Python's built-in optimizations to handle larger strings efficiently.

**Example**

```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import uppercase

# Call the function with your input string
input_string = "hello world"
result = uppercase(input_string)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'HELLO WORLD'

```

## 4. `sort_list(word_list)`

The **'sort_list'** function uses the built-in **sorted()** function to perform a stable sort on the list of words. We will explore the time complexity of this operation and discuss how it handles various data types.

**Example**

```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import sort_list

# Call the function with your input list
word_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
result = sort_list(word_list)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

## 5. `count_word_occurrences(word_list, target_word)`

The **'count_word_occurrences'** function iterates through the list of words to count the occurrences of the target word. We will analyze its time complexity and discuss potential optimizations for large datasets.

**Example**

```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import count_word_occurrences

# Call the function with your input word list and target word
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'banana', 'kiwi']
target_word = 'banana'
result = count_word_occurrences(word_list, target_word)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 2

```

##  6. `find_and_replace(source_string, target_word, replacement_word)`

The find_and_replace function uses Python's built-in string replacement method, but we will explore some alternative approaches and discuss their pros and cons.

```
# Import the function from the module
from string_manipulation import find_and_replace

# Call the function with your input source string, target word, and replacement word
source_string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
target_word = "fox"
replacement_word = "cat"
result = find_and_replace(source_string, target_word, replacement_word)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 'The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog.'

```
